# Spring Boot Web Reactive Starter

This experimental project provides a simple way to try the new
[Web Reactive support in Spring Framework 5.0](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/html/web-reactive.html).

## Quickstart

Go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io), set the Spring Boot version to `2.0.0(SNAPSHOT)` and add the "Reactive Web" starter.

From there you can take a look at [spring-boot-sample-web-reactive](spring-boot-sample-web-reactive) in this repository to see examples of reactive `@Controller`s and the reactive `WebClient` in use.

## Server Runtime

By default this Boot Starter uses embedded Tomcat as the default server runtime.

Switching the server is easy. Simply exclude the Tomcat
starter and add the dependency you want as shown here with
[Reactor Netty](https://github.com/reactor/reactor-ipc):

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.boot.experimental</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web-reactive</artifactId>
	<exclusions>
		<exclusion>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-tomcat</artifactId>
		</exclusion>
	</exclusions>
</dependency>
<dependency>
	<groupId>io.projectreactor.ipc</groupId>
	<artifactId>reactor-netty</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

An example of the same in Gradle and a switch to [RxNetty](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxNetty):

```groovy
compile('org.springframework.boot.experimental:spring-boot-starter-web-reactive') {
	exclude group: 'org.springframework.boot', module: 'spring-boot-starter-tomcat'
}
compile "io.reactivex:rxnetty-common"
compile "io.reactivex:rxnetty-http"
compile "io.reactivex:rxjava-reactive-streams"
```

Below are the supported server runtimes. For the exact dependencies check out
the [sample project build](https://github.com/bclozel/spring-boot-web-reactive/blob/master/spring-boot-sample-web-reactive/pom.xml):

* Reactor Netty
* Tomcat
* Jetty
* RxNetty
* Undertow

## Annotation-based or Functional API

As described in the ["Reactive Web Applications"](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/5.0.0.M4/spring-framework-reference/html/web-reactive.html) Spring Framework 5.0 reference documentation, the Web Reactive framework comes in 2 flavors :
 - Annotation-based with `@Controller` and the other annotations supported also with Spring MVC
 - Functional, Java 8 lambda style routing and handling
 
Support of the annotation-based variant works like Spring MVC supports: `@Controller` beans are taking automatically in account. But we also introduced support for the functional variant. Such support is triggered by `RouterFunction` beans which can be annotated with any `@Component` style annotation (`@Controller` being one of the possible choices if you put your `RouterFunction` and `HandlerFunction`in the same class). You can see an example of such Spring Boot functional web application with this [functional-web-playground](https://github.com/snicoll-scratches/functional-web-playground) java-based sample application or this [MiXiT](https://github.com/mix-it/mixit/) Kotlin-based project.

## `WebClient` Dependencies

Spring Framework 5 also provides a reactive `WebClient`.
For now the only supported HTTP client is Reactor Netty.
Other HTTP clients such as Jetty and RxNetty will be added in the next milestone.

## Resources

The Spring team has published a few blog posts on the subject:

* [Reactive Spring](https://spring.io/blog/2016/02/09/reactive-spring)
* [Understanding Reactive types](https://spring.io/blog/2016/04/19/understanding-reactive-types)
* Notes on Reactive Programming [part I](https://spring.io/blog/2016/06/07/notes-on-reactive-programming-part-i-the-reactive-landscape),

## Supported configuration keys

Configuration class | Supported properties | Notes
------------ | ------------- | -------------
`ReactiveServerProperties` | `server.port`, `server.address` |
`ResourceProperties` | `spring.resources.*` |
`WebReactiveProperties` | `spring.reactive.static-path-pattern` |
`ReactorCoreProperties` | `spring.reactor.stacktrace-mode.enabled` | Defaults to `true` if devtools is on the classpath, should be set to `false` in production for best performance.

## Known issues

This starter doesn't work with plain `@SpringBootTest`s (i.e. with a `WebEnvironment.MOCK`, which is the default):

```
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unable to call initializer.
Object of class [org.springframework.boot.context.embedded.ExperimentalReactiveWebApplicationContext]
must be an instance of interface org.springframework.web.context.ConfigurableWebApplicationContext
```

Web integration tests `@SpringBootTest`s are working properly,
for example `@SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT)`.

## FAQ

**I've found an issue, I have a question - where should I report it?**

* You can report issues in this Github project or on https://jira.spring.io if this is a Spring Framework issue
* You can ask questions in Github issues as well or join the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot)

**Will this be available in Spring Boot? When?**

Yes! Check out the [Spring Boot milestones](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/milestones) and especially
[the dedicated issue](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/4908).

**Is Spring Boot required to run Spring Web Reactive?**

It certainly makes things easier, but it's not mandatory.
For manual bootstrapping, please [read the reference documentation]
(http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/html/web-reactive.html#web-reactive-getting-started-manual).
