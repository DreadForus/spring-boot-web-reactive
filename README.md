# Spring Boot Web Reactive Starter

This experimental project has been merged in Spring Boot 2.0 with the new `spring-boot-starter-webflux`.

Please refer to the
[Web Reactive support in Spring Framework 5.0](http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/html/web-reactive.html)
and the [Spring Boot 2.0 reference documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/reference/html/).

## Quickstart

Go to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io), set the Spring Boot version to `2.0.0(SNAPSHOT)` and add the "WebFlux" starter.

From there you can take a look at the
[WebFlux sample apps in the spring boot repository](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-samples#spring-boot-samples).

## FAQ

**I've found an issue, I have a question - where should I report it?**

* You can report issues in the [Spring Boot Github tracker](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/labels/theme%3A%20webflux) or on https://jira.spring.io if this is a Spring Framework issue
* You can ask questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) and/or join the [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-boot)

**Is Spring Boot required to run Spring Web Reactive?**

It certainly makes things easier, but it's not mandatory.
For manual bootstrapping, please [read the reference documentation]
(http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/5.0.0.BUILD-SNAPSHOT/spring-framework-reference/html/web-reactive.html#web-reactive-getting-started-manual).
